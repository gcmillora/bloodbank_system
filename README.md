# CMSC127 - Bloodbank Donation System

A bloodbank donation management system using HTML/CSS/PHP and MySQL. There are 3 user types, specifically, the user, hospital and admin. Users can request or donate, while hospitals can see requests and the available stock of their hospital. Moreover, the admin can view the list of the hospitals and users in the database.

As an extension to the included features of the project, we included actions like sorting, approve/deny etc. using PHP. For every account type, there is a different session interface.
